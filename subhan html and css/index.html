                        <p> Today, the sky is the limit, and each one of us needs to pursue post-graduation. With the help of PG, you can secure a better job, and it opens the door for a lot of other opportunities too. There is a substantial increase in the pay scale, and the learning curve certainly improves too. The PG Course can also help you in changing your stream or to gain intra-domain experience. One example of this is the engineers who opt for an MBA degree in their post-graduation. This opens up the door for the managerial roles, and it eventually helps them in climbing the ladder to higher management roles.</p>

                    <p>The best aspects is that living on campus is extremely easy to go to lectures and all scheduled events, it is easy to go round and there are many things you can do such as walk around the farm etc, as well as this there is also access to the bus to get to and back from Newport. The worst aspect is that there is not that much to do when things are not taking place such as there are not many communal areas for students to meet and chat, as well as this in catered accommodations there is no access to an oven or hob which is kind of annoying when we have to make our own foods on weekends. Apart from that this university is great and I am loving it. </p>
